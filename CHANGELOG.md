# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

- Migrate the OMP WeChat (iLink) bridge into dsh as a first-class bundle service: `/wechat-*` commands, `@dsh` remote commands, `wechat_send`/`wechat_status` tools, automatic progress/result push, and WeChat-aware ask bridging.
- Optimize overlay dialogs: center them by default, enlarge ask/user-question dialogs to 90% width/height, and enlarge general dialogs to 80% width/85% height so content is less likely to be folded.
- Add a default config section in `/settings` for startup permission mode, model, and reasoning effort; `/new` now continues the current session's permission instead of the global default.
- Rework `/settings` around OMP's full-screen framed layout: tabbed label/value rows, preserved cursors, current-value preselection, nested Escape-to-back navigation, and stale async-view guards.
- Expand `/settings` with more configurable items: show reasoning, tool output lines, default mode, max parallel tool calls, custom provider/model entries (with editing of saved custom IDs), and move default model/effort onto the Model tab with visible Provider/Model rows.
- Add a single-page custom model form: provider, model, and reasoning effort are shown together with save-target checkboxes and Save/Cancel actions, so no more one-field-per-screen wizard.
- Reorganize `/settings` into General / Models & Providers / Advanced tabs; add provider editing/creation with Base URL, API key, API type (fixed Chat Completions / Completions / Responses, matching WebUI), model list, upstream model discovery, manual model entry, and preset templates, all persisted through dsh settings.
- Fix default mode persistence: `/settings` 中保存的 `agent-presets.default` 现在会在新会话启动时生效，不再固定回退到 `standard`。
- Expose each skill as a `skill:<name>` quick command in the composer, so typing `/` lists them and fuzzy search can find them by partial names (e.g. `commit` → `skill:git-commit`); completion keeps the no-space syntax.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-15

- Add `/new` for in-process fresh-session creation.
- Keep abandoned sessions unmaterialized until they contain conversation data.
- Submit exact slash-command arguments, including `/mode minimal`, with one Enter press.
- Add `/think [level]` with model-specific effort completion, cycling, and persistence.
- Wrap the mode, path, and Git prompt in one OMP-style dark Powerline surface.
- Discover and switch any locally installed agent preset via `/mode`.
- Advertise the configured `/permission` modes in help, inline hints, and argument completion, with localized built-in descriptions.
- Make narrow sidebars use coherent compact status segments and keep permission state visible after context usage.
- Sanitize carriage returns from shell output so multiline tool cards keep their borders intact.
- Present the unrestricted permission preset as `full-access`, show a startup reminder when it is active, and highlight it with the theme's emphasis color.
- Harden session resume: avoid quadratic transcript rebuilds, make Git branch reads non-blocking, cap resume/title loading with timeouts, and surface resume failures.
- Keep the hardware cursor visible in the editor so IMEs that preview pinyin/composition text place it inline at the cursor instead of at the line end.
- Cap the compact mode segment to 4 CJK / 8 ASCII columns with an ellipsis so long preset ids like `anchored-standard` stay compact.
- Rework the footer compression order: compress the model with a middle ellipsis first, then drop the `ctx` prefix, and only then remove lower-priority segments.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-14

- Initial public dsh profile bundle.
- OMP-styled Catppuccin terminal layout with responsive welcome panel.
- Chronological user, injected-context, assistant, reasoning, and tool rendering.
- GitHub Release tarball workflow for reproducible profile installation.
